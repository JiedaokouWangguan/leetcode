子贡倦于学，告之于曰：“愿有所息。”仲尼曰：“生无所息。”子贡曰：“然则赐息无所乎？”仲尼曰：“有焉耳，望其圹，皋如也，宰如也，坟如也，鬲如也，则知所息矣。”

English Version:
In a parallel universe(where Confucius and his students are so irritable and rude). One day Zi Gong, a student of Confucius, felt tired of learning. So he told Confucius:"I'm so f\*\*king tired! I'm gonna have a good rest!!!" While Confucius said:"You shouldn't take a rest until you are f\*\*king dead!"
