# A Little Story
Chinese version(It's real!):  
子贡倦于学，告之于孔子曰：“愿有所息。”仲尼曰：“生无所息。”子贡曰：“然则赐息无所乎？”仲尼曰：“有焉耳，望其圹，皋如也，宰如也，坟如也，鬲如也，则知所息矣。”

English Version:  
(In a parallel universe where Confucius and his students are not that courteous) One day Zi Gong, a student of Confucius, felt tired of learning. So he told Confucius:"I'm so f\*\*king tired! I'm gonna have a good rest!!!" While Confucius said:"You can't take a rest." Zi Gong was confused and asked:"So in this f\*\*king world, there is nowhere for me to take a rest?" Confucius responded "YOU SHOULD NOT REST UNTIL YOU ARE F\*\*KING DEAD!"
